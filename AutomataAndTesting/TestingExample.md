**Use Case Example:**

Task: Translate a binary representation of braille into the word "hello"

Breaking down the word into binary representations of each letter:
"h" = "101100"
"e" = "100100"
"l" = "101010"
"l" = "101010"
"o" = "100110"

Combine each character's string into one full string:
"101100100100101010101010100110"

Feed the string into the appropriate line of the driver.py file:
print(accept(a, "101100100100101010101010100110"))

Program Output:

As we can see, the input string was valid, as indicated by the "accept" line at the beginning of the output.
Following that, we can see a long list of state transitions.
For every seven line chunk, the first six lines show the valid state transitions as the input traverses through the DFA, while the seventh line shows the transition to the accepting state with the letter that was produced from the six digit string chunk.
